# Covid-19-saves-distance-detection


An AI tool to prevent spreading of coronavirus (COVID-19) by using computer vision on video surveillance.
A social distancing analyzer AI tool to regulate social distancing protocol using video surveillance of CCTV cameras and drones. Social Distancing Analyser to prevent COVID19


## For education purpose only, meant as my contribution towards society

Social Distancing Analyser automatically detects the extent to which social distancing protocols are followed in the area.
Deploying it on current surveillance systems and drones used by police to monitor large areas can help to prevent coronavirus by allowing automated and better tracking of activities happening in the area. It shows analytics of the area in real time. It can also be used to alert police in case of considerable violation of social distancing protocols in a particular area.
